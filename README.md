Product Customization Add-ons, former Product Fields Admin WordPress plugin to create and manage **customization options** for WooCommerce, improving the end user experience by allowing them to customize items before purchase, if the store owner offers it.

## How is that different from WooCommerce attributes?

This approach enhances WooCommerce's flexibility by allowing admins to create interactive, custom fields for each product, enabling unique user inputs and creating a more personalized shopping experience. This differs from WooCommerce's attribute system, which is limited to pre-defined options and does not allow user customization.
